    <span>Welcome to our platform!
        <br> We have compiled a tool that aids in discovering various facts and figures regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
        <br> This condition has been described as "the complex somatic, cognitive, affective, and behavioral effects of psychological trauma", and is linked to be caused 
        by a myriad of traumatic experiences. Intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and hypervigilance are a few examples of consequences that characterize PTSD. </span>
        
    <br> <br> Our research is directed towards identifying the interactions between known PTSD treatment drugs and their target proteins. Additionally, we aimed to represent the relevant 
        biological mechanisms the drugs are involved in. 
    <bt>information on how the results on the homepage should be interpreted (do this once bubbles etc are there and final look of page is clear)
        <br> for example: the babble chart contains this; click on it and you get this.. etc
        <br> hope you enjoy!
