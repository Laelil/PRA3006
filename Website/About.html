      About the project
  </div>
    
    </div> 
    <p>We have developed this platform as part of the 'Programming in the Life Sciences' skills course, offered at the Maastricht Science Programme.<br>
       Our project was compiled over the course of four weeks, during which we used a variety of programming platforms and online tools to help achieve our final product.<br>
       More specifically, we gathered relevant data for our research question using SPARQL queries, and applied the JavaScript library 'D3.js' to visualize this data using HTML and CSS.<br>
       Results of this finalized piece of work are visualized in an interactive graph on the homepage, where details on how to use our website are outlined.</p>
    
    <p>For a complete survey of all of the code that was implemented into our website, users can refer to the online GitHub repository: "add link".<br>
        Here, we also disclose the particularities of the public licence applied to our project, as well as other public resources we used.</p>
