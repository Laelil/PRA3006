# README
This code provides a visual representation of the biological question we aimed to investigate during our project in the practical course: Programming of The Life Sciences. Our research is focused on PTSD treatment drugs and their interaction with biological pathways. 
Underneath, you can find directions on running the code and using the platform.

## Running the code
1. Download the ZIP file named 'Website' in this Github repository.
2. Once downloaded, open the following file: 'Homepage', which exhibits our website's main page.
3. For a detailed explanation on how to use this plaform, refer to the information below.

## Using the platform
* Our homepage displays a bubble graph in which each 'larger' bubble corresponds to a drug class.
* The user can click on any bubble to display the list of drugs beloning to the designated class.
* If more information regarding a particular drug is desired, the user can refer to the 'Drug list' tab.
* This page contains the information for each drug in the database, users can use the search bar for quick access to the relevant drug.
