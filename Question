question ideas
  - protein folds by ai (try to predict how 1 protein folds and then compare it to how an actual protein folds irl) -> that's probably too complicated?
  -> something with foldit? protein crystallization?
  - drug targeting
  - disease effect on genes
  - neurotransmitters of 1 brain disease/disorder
  --> visualization of the effect of fluoxetine on a brain with ptsd
  
  - we could look at the effectivity of each drug on its target and put this into a chart
  
  Formulating question:
  - What effects do drugs used to trest ptsd have on ptsd itself, involved proteins, and on all biological mechanisms?
  - Drug targeting in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
  - How do PTSD treatment drugs interact with their target proteins, and which biological processes are these proteins involved in? 
 
  FINAL QUESTION
  Drug targeting in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
  How do PTSD treatment drugs interact with their target proteins, and what is their role in relevant biological mechanisms? 
  
  FINAL PROJECT
  - build HTML website 
  - add some javascript language
  - create webservice to get data
  - present tool and provide data - finally answering the biological question
