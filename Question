question ideas
  - protein folds by ai (try to predict how 1 protein folds and then compare it to how an actual protein folds irl) -> that's probably too complicated?
  -> something with foldit? protein crystallization?
  - drug targeting
  - disease effect on genes
  - neurotransmitters of 1 brain disease/disorder
  --> visualization of the effect of fluoxetine on a brain with ptsd
